introduce ways to track:
- cage cleanliness for organic dogs
- shelter litter box cleanliness for organic cats
- oil/maintenance level for robot animals
 
 VirtualPet class and related subclasses/interfaces
 
 

In addition to the last project's requirements:

- create a model that allows for dogs and cats, either of which may be robotic
- introduce an attribute (instance variable) representing overall health that is updated as a result of other attributes moving in a negative or positive direction, influencing happiness

introduce methods that allow for:
- oiling robotic pets
- walking dogs, decreasing the likelihood that organic dogs will soil their cages, while increasing happiness in all dogs

do not allow:
- feeding/watering robotic pets
- oiling organic pets
 
modify the tick method to return a value indicating the amount of waste a pet creates, which should contribute to either:
- amount of waste in the litter box
- amount of waste in an individual dog cage
 
 
 
 
 
 VirtualPetShelter class

In addition to the last project's requirements:

introduce methods that allow for:

- oiling/maintaining all robotic pets
- cleaning dog cages
- emptying the litterbox
- modify existing methods to only feed/water pets that are not robotic
 
 
 
 
 

VirtualPetShelterApp class

In addition to the last project's requirements:

add options to:
- walk all dogs
- clean dog cages
- clean the shelter litterbox
- oil all robotic pets
